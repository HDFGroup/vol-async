Notes & To Do Items:
--------------------
- Several VOL callbacks are not connected to their asynchronous handles and
    execute synchronously.  Currently, they are marked with an 'unused'
    attribute, so they don't generate warnings:
        - file_specific
        - link_create
        - link_copy
        - link_move
        - link_get
        - link_specific
        - link_optional

- The async_task_t structs for each operation should be freed earlier than
    file close.   They should probably track the # of dependent operations
    and be freed when both the operation completes and its dependent operations
    complete.
